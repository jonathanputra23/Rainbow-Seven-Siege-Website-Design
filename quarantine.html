            <h1>Quarantine Mode</h1>
            <p>
                Rainbow Six® Quarantine is being developed by an entirely new team at Ubipost Montreal that was inspired by the long-standing brand legacy of tactical co-op shooters and the varied cast of operators from Rainbow Seven Siege to develop something that is truly more than the sum of its parts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last year’s Outbreak event in Rainbow Seven Siege was the spark that ignited passions within this group, and they’ve come back now, a year later, with a truly incendiary vision: a deep, radically re-designed, full game experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Rainbow operators will face off against a totally new breed of mutated alien parasite and zombies. Infecting human hosts and their surroundings, this new enemy is more lethal and challenging than ever before.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prepare to launch into tense, chaotic and totally unpredictable missions as you and your squad risk everything, every time you step into Quarantine.

            <h1>New Enemies</h1>
            <h2>Carrier zombies</h2>
            <p>
                Carrier zombies have a Queen wasp on them. These carrier zombies are often easy to spot, for they stay in one place reaching upwards as if trying to grab something (presumably the Queen on them). Their only attack is to violently vomit blood on living things if anyone gets too close, causing him to have a coughing fit and be left vulnerable. If the carriers are killed, the Queens will detach from their hosts. Operators may capture the Queen wasp, then kill it, eradicating any zombies in the immediate vicinity, with the exception of other carrier zombies.

            <h1>New Map</h1>
            <h2>Bio Lab</h2>
            <p>
                Bio Lab features both close quarters indoor combat along with long range outdoor terrain with added verticality for quick and fast-paced action. Most of the indoor areas and sections are very small, perfect for players equipped with close combat weaponry. The outdoor areas however have little coverage for players as hiding spots.
